    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Company 1, Location</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Job Title - (MM/YYYY)-Present</strong></p>
    <p>This is where you write about your experience. Do not simply list your day-to-day job duties. Work in resume keywords that are most relevant to the job for which you’re applying. Try replacing some of your duties with measurable results and accomplishments rather than duties. Remember, “duties tell, accomplishments sell.” To create a strong measurable result, try this format: [Action verb] [brief explanation of accomplishment] resulting in [quantifiable outcome. Using %, $, etc. will draw the eye and make an impact]. For example: “Responded to an average of 203 customer service emails per week, improving response time by 74% and customer satisfaction by 31% between 2016 to 2017.” 
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>Company 2, Location</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Job Title - (MM/YYYY)-Present</strong></p>
    <p>Keep your sentences short and to the point. This will make it easier for a recruiter or hiring manager to read or skim. Use your limited space to focus on things are that most relevant to the new job, rather than going into every detail about the responsibilities that took up most of your time. Tailor your resume to the job description.
