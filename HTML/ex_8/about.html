    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

        Checkmate... They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

        Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. Checkmate... God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. Did he just throw my cat out of the window?
